# HackAssembler
A project that is part of 5 software built in [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken

## Background
The sixth project in the ***Nand2Tetris*** series involves developing an assembler for the ***Hack assembly language***. This follows the previous five chapters, where a CPU was constructed from basic logic gates, culminating in the creation of the Hack machine language designed to run on this CPU. In this project, a Hack assembler is implemented using ***C++***, responsible for translating Hack assembly programs into binary machine code that can be executed by the ***Hack CPU***. The assembler serves as a critical component in the overall system, bridging high-level programming and hardware execution.

## Architecture of HackAssembler
I have followed the [recommended architecture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uKGRMnL-gqk9DsgeN50z0EpHoSMWe6F5/view) from the lecture slides.
